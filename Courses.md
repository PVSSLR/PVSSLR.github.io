<p align="justify">I love to learn new things whenever I get the free time. For the past few years, I have been completing online certification courses every month and it has become my new habit. I audit courses from various platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, Edx, etc. I do believe that what we learn matters the most than these certificates.</p>
