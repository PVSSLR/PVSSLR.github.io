<p align="justify">I love to learn new things whenever I get the free time. For the past few years, I have been completing online certification courses every month and it has become my new habit. I audit courses from various platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, Edx, etc. I do believe that what we learn matters the most than these certificates.</p>

<h3> Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning, Udemy, March 2020</h3>

<p align="justify">After using Remote sensing/Image processing softwares such as ERDAS, ENVI, SNAP. I wanted to learn image processing using python to apply in the field of remote sensing and robotics.  This course is well structured and all the code are created using jupyter live script. I learned image processing, video processing using OpenCV. It also has an Capstone project which is helpful since we could implement what ever we learned.</p>


<h3> CAD and Digital Manufacturing Specialization, Coursera, November 2019 - Present</h3>

Currently attending this course. This course is based on generative design which is the future.

<h3> Drone Programming Primer for Software Development, Udemy, August 2019</h3>

<p align="justify">It took three days for me just to install the required softwares (Dronekit, MAVproxy, Mission planner ) in Ubuntu for this course but believe me after that I understood how a linux operating system works. What if you can simulate and command a drone or ROV in a virtual enviroment and it can also be implemented in real life. I learned how the hardware, software and firmware of drone intereact with each other. After this course you can make your own drone using APM or pixhawk and pre plan their flight path. </p>

<h3> Beginning Fortran for Science and Engineering Students, Udemy, August 2019</h3>

<p align="justify">As we know Fortran is a legacy languages.I was lucky to find this course since  its hard to find tutorials or a course based on fortran. This course covers the basic syntax part of fortran95. Good for those who want to experience fortran.</p>

<h3>  Geoprocessing using python, IIRS-ISRO Outreach Programme, July 2019 </h3>

<p align="justify">This course was conducted by Indian Institute of Remote Sensing which is a part of Indian space research organisation. Here I learned about geoprocessing using python libraries such as OGR, geopandas, numpy, GDAL etc and other concepts such as vector analysis, raster analysis. Later I got an oppurtunity to visit IIRS and during that I had an advantage since I already attended this course.</p>

<h3> Arduino Step by Step More than 50 Hours Complete Course, Udemy, June 2019 </h3>

<p align="justify">This course not only teaches about Arduino but also other things like C Programming, PCB designing, various controllers (PID, PIC), IOT. It took some time to complete this course but it was worth it.</p>

<h3> ENGR2000X: A Hands-on Introduction to Engineering Simulations, edX, May 2019 </h3>

<p align="justify">This course is conducted by Cornell University and sponsored by ANSYS. From mathematical modelling to Building simulations of real-world applications using ANSYSÂ® software. You can learn how to conduct simulations for fluid dynamics, structural mechanics using ANSYS.</p>

<h3> Linux Command Line Basics, Udemy, Feburary 2019 </h3>

<p align="justify">In today's world, learning Linux is a must since its an open source and used in various fields. For example, in server deployment, robotics(ROS), embedded systems and the list goes on. This course help you to navigate, manipulate, create, view files, write custom linux commands, install virtual machine etc using linux command line.</p>

<h3> Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Coursera, August 2018 </h3>

<p align="justify">This course introduce you to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Though, it is a short course it helped me to design and modify various part of this website. If you want to learn full web development I suggest Dr. Angela Yu's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.<p>
	
<h3> Python for Everybody Specialization, Coursera, May 2018 - March 2019 </h3>

<p align="justify">This one of my favorite courses, the course instructor Dr. charles severance has done an excellent work and 
the way he teaches this course makes it more intresting. This course is the first part of the python specialization. This course
doesnt ends here, you will also get an oppurtunity to meet him in person if he visits your country. You will be notified on the time of 
his arrival through coursera.</p>

<h3> MATLAB for the Absolute Beginner, Udemy, May 2018 </h3>

<p align="justify">This is a very good refresher course for those who have already used matlab, you can learn
how to plot graphs, GUIs, animations using matlab. It also has an introduction section to simulink.</p>
