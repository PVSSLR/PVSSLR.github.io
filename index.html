I believe that one could find a solution to every problem through nature. What if we could mimic the locomotion of a 
cheetah or predict the behavior of a swarm of bees?. This is  where mathematics plays a vital role. My dream is to design 
mathematical models for such cases and to implement them in real-life applications (bio-inspired robotics).<br>

Would love to collaborate in the field of biorobotics, remote sensing, ecology. I can be reached via
