## EFFECT OF CHOPPED CARBON FIBRE REINFORCED WITH NATURAL FIBRES

<img src="{{ 'images/fibres2.jpg' | relative_url }}" />

The mechanical characterization of chopped carbon fibre (CCF) of different lengths (0.5cm and 1cm) mixed with Epoxy Resin 
(commercial name: LY556) added as a reinforcement to the flax/sisal composite laminates. The natural composite laminates 
were fabricated with the two different materials such as flax/sisal with and without adding chopped Carbon fibre of varying 
length by using hand Layup technique. To enhance the mechanical properties of natural composite laminates, alkali treatment 
was carried out for flax/sisal fibre, was treated with 5% solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) about 2 hours to remove the 
unwanted soluble cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin. The natural composite laminates were investigated for their mechanical
properties by tensile and flexural tests. The mechanical properties were compared for natural composite Laminates with and without 
the reinforcement of chopped Carbon fibre of different lengths. The experimental result indicated that flax/epoxy composite laminate
had enhanced the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and flexural strength than sisal/epoxy composite laminate.
