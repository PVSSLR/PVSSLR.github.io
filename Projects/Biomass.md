## Vegetation Index and Above Ground Biomass Estimation using SAR Imagery

<p align="justify">
This project intends to study the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric behaviour for vegetation and to predict the above ground biomass using SAR imagery. Ladakh region in India was selected for the biomass estimation in this study and data were collected using destructive harvesting method. Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is an ecologically and economically important shrub native in that region.  Sentinel-1A (S1A) operating at the C-band were downloaded with high-resolution Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) and Dual Polarization (VV & VH) for each month from February 2017 to December 2017. The images were pre-processed using SNAP.  Landsat 8 OLI Optical images were downloaded to determine NDVI. The image was pre-processed using Semi-Automatic Classification plugin in QGIS. Normalized difference Vegetation Index and Radar vegetation index were calculated and compared. The present study indicated that VH polarization has potentiality in vegetation classification than the VV polarization of sentinel 1A. Moreover, the moderate co-relation between VH/VV and biomass indicates possibility of use of this vegetation index in biomass estimation study.  However, further study is required, as the present study has done only for the limited above ground sample.</p>
