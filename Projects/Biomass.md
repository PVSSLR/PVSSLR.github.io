## Vegetation Index and Above Ground Biomass Estimation using SAR Imagery
## Introduction 
Biomass is the measure of all living and non-living matter present in vegetation. It is
accumulated through the various processes such as photosynthesis, mineral nutrition, and
nutrient uptake through plant roots. Biomass is a long term reserve of carbon in plants. It is
divided in two types, fresh and dry biomass. The fresh biomass constitutes of immediately
harvested vegetation, with its natural moisture content. Fresh biomass when dried under sun
or in oven to remove its moisture content becomes dry biomass. Both, fresh and dry biomass
is used in ecological research.
The range of carbon present in plant biomass is approximately found between 45-50% (Ma et
al., 2018). Quantifying the biomass of healthy vegetation provides an important ecological
parameter for the health of the ecosystem of the vegetation type. The balance of
biogeochemical cycles interacting between plant, soil and atmosphere can be predicted
through the health of biomass accumulation in plants. For instance, carbon, nitrogen cycles
are two major biogeochemical cycles associated with plants nutrient cycling and biomass
accumulation across all vegetation types.
Measuring the health of biomass provides details of a healthy biogeochemical cycling in the
ecosystem. Since biomass is a direct reserve of carbon, it plays an essential role in
maintaining the carbon balance of the ecosystem. It can therefore be used as a long term
sustainable strategy to mitigate global warming and climate change. Carbon stock is the
measure of carbon present in the biomass at any given time. Carbon flux is the rate exchange
of carbon between plant biomass, soil and atmosphere. Measuring biomass can provide the
details of carbon stock and carbon fluxes in the vegetation. The field method used for
measuring biomass is the destructive harvest method and allometric methods using plant
dimensions. Further remote sensing methods explored to measure the biomass are through the
optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In the destructive harvest method,
the plants are directly harvested for their above ground parts (crown, stem and leaves) and
below ground parts (roots) and weighed using measuring scale to find biomass. The
allometric method is based on relationship between plant height, volume, diameter and breast
height, crown dimensions and wood density to find biomass.
Optical remote sensing is also used for the estimation of biomass. It works well in the
homogeneous forest stands but has limitations of cloud cover. SAR (Synthetic Aperture
Radar) used in microwave remote sensing can overcome the cloud cover limitation to predict

biomass in all weather conditions (Chen et al., 2017). Sentinel-1 provides SAR image and
Sentinel-2 provides optical image which could be processed in Sentinelâ€™s Application
Platform (SNAP). Since both optical and SAR image could be obtained from Sentinel-2 &
Sentinel-1, therefore it could be conveniently used for the study of biomass while giving the
comparison between SAR and optical data.Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
is used in visible and near Infrared Bands in the optical remote sensing to detect the live
green vegetation. Similarly Radar Vegetation Index could be used for detecting accurate
vegetation cover in SAR, microwave remote sensing. The determination of Biomass using
Sentinel-1 (SAR) image is done in Changbai mountains in China to predict the above ground
biomass and development of allometric models using correlation between backscattering
coefficients, polarizations (VV, VH, VV/VH) and ground data of biomass (Chen et al., 2017).
Using the Sentinel-2 optical image the determination of above ground biomass was done by
correlating the NDVI with above ground biomass (Askar et al., 2018).
Ladakh region in India was selected for the biomass estimation in this study. Ladakh is a
trans-Himalayan cold desert located in High Altitude. It is a fragile ecosystem with extremely
sparse vegetation. Therefore, studying the vegetation biomass in this region is essential to
know the health of the ecosystem. Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is an ecologically
and economically important shrub native to Ladakh region in India. It grows extensively in
Ladakh and the biomass of Hippophae rhamnoides in Ladakh is estimated by destructive
harvest method (Kumar et al., 2019). (Zhang and Chen, 2007) studied the above and below
ground biomass of in the pure Hippophae rhamnoides stand in eastern Loess plateau of China
using destructive harvest and allometric methods. Hippophae rhamnoides biomass will be
determined in this study using remote sensing (Optical & SAR) in this study. Since the
ground data was available for this shrub therefore it was selected in this study. This study is
intends to find the relationship of the ground biomass data and the data from Optical & SAR
images.
