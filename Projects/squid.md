##  SQUID JET PROPULSION

Squid jet propulsion is an efficient mode of underwater propulsion.  Squid is a biological living marine organism, which 
locomotes  by compressing and expanding the body(mantle). For jet propulsion to occur, the water flows into the mantle 
cavity and over the gills through an opening by head. The mantle builds internal pressure by sealing off all orifices. 
The thick muscles of mantle wall contract squeezing water out of the narrow funnel with enough force to propel the animal
in a speedy burst.
This project is to make a silent mode of propulsion compared to the high noise-makers “submarines” and also to create an 
efficient mode of propulsion by eliminating the use of fuel and other heat emitting devices which helps in the environmental
-friendly operations. This is done by the compression and expansion of a rubber bladder by the use of mechanical arms and a 
power source like a DC motor. The polarity of the motor can be changed using three pin switch, so that arm moves in both 
direction (for compression and expansion of the bladder). The vehicle propels itself by the jet created by the bladder. 
This can be made to move faster by using an higher torque and r.p.m DC motor, which further adds to the fastest mode of propulsion
with more efficiency. The propulsive efficiency can be greatly increased when the water jetted by the bladder during the jet period
is more than the water intake during the refill period.
